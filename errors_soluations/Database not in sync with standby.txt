Tow cases :
1. Are you setting up a new dataguard environment and having issues or 
2.The Environment is there already and was working before but its out of sync.
These two scenario require a different approach to resolve. 
Resolve 1. 
Make sure you have all the setting in the parameter file right. 
Things like data file convert, archive destination and fal server/client,dg_config. 
Start the stanby instance, don't mount it. 
Connect target (Production) and Auxiliary (Standby), 
then Run:duplicate target database for standby from active database
Resolve 2.
You need to find out what is the last archive that was sent to the standby database. 
and check if all the archives from the sequence number to the current archive are still on disk. 
If not and they are backed up, then you need to restore the archives to the 
original destination then oracle will do the rest to resolve the issue
